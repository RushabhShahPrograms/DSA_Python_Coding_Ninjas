## Circular doubly LL
1. Given an unsorted circular doubly linked list, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?

i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Ans: **I,II,III and IV**

## Traversal in LL
2. In doubly linked lists, traversal can be done in?

Ans: **Both Directions**

## Double LL
3. Given an unsorted doubly linked list, suppose you have references (or pointer) to its head and tail nodes, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?

i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Ans: **I,II,III and IV**
