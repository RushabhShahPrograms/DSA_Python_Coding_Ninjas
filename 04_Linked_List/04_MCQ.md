## Search in LL

1. What will be the time complexity of searching an element in the linked list?

Ans: **O(n)**

## Add element at last

2. Consider the Singly linked list having n elements. What will be the time taken to add an node at the end of linked list if is initially pointing to first node of the list.

That is only head is given to you.

Ans: **O(n)**

## Insert at 2nd position

3. There is reference (or pointer) to first Node of the Linked List, then time required to insert element to second position is _____ .

Indexing starts from 0.

Ans: **O(1)**

## Operations in O(1)

4. Given an unsorted singly Linked List, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?

i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Ans: **I and IV**

5. Given an unsorted singly Linked List, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head and tail nodes, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?

i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Ans: **I,II and IV**
