# 2048 Game

So I created this game by learning from the videos of coding ninjas tutorial.

Game is build in python using tkinter.
The main files created are 2048.py, constants.py, finallogics.py

Game is converted into exe using this command:
- `pip install pyinstaller`
- `pyinstaller --onefile -w 2048.py`
